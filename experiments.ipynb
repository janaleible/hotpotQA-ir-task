href=\\\\\"gravitational%20time%20dilation\\\\\">gravitational time dilation</a>, and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.\", \" Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at <a href=\\\\\"mean%20sea%20level\\\\\">mean sea level</a> (the geoid).\", \" Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about one part in a trillion.\", \" The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name \\\\\"EAL\\\\\" (\\\\\"Echelle Atomique Libre\\\\\", meaning \\\\\"Free Atomic Scale\\\\\").\"], [\"The

href=\\\\\"Geocentric%20Coordinate%20Time\\\\\">Geocentric Coordinate Time</a> (TCG), and <a href=\\\\\"Terrestrial%20Time\\\\\">Terrestrial Time</a> (TT), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system.\", \" All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.\", \" (The offset is to provide continuity with the older <a href=\\\\\"Ephemeris%20Time\\\\\">Ephemeris Time</a>.)\", \" TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184\\\\u00a0s.\"], [\"The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated \\\\\"In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC.\\\\\"\"], [\"UTC is a <a href=\\\\\"discontinuous\\\\\">discontinuous</a> (i.e. regularly adjusted by leap seconds) time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time.\", \" From its beginning in 1961 through December 1971 the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated <a href=\\\\\"UT2\\\\\">UT2</a>.\", \" Afterwards these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate <a href=\\\\\"UT1\\\\\">UT1</a>.\", \" This was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale; the post-1971 more linear transformation of the BIH\\'s atomic time meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally.\", \" The fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as <a href=\\\\\"navigation\\\\\">navigation</a> which require a source of Universal Time
